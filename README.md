# Poetry_Generation
Built a DL model using LSTM, Embedding and Dense layers to Generate Text.
The Model takes in sequences and outputs a word which is then included in the input sequence and fed again to generate another word, this process is repeated to generate a output sequence of desired length.
The Model achieved an Accuracy of 84.49% on the Corpus.
