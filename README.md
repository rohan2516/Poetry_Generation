# Poetry_Generation
Built a Deep Learning Model using LSTM, Embedding and Dense layers to Generate Text.
The Model takes in sequences and outputs a word which is then included in the input sequence and fed again to the Model to generate another word, this process is repeated to generate an output sequence of desired length.
The Model achieved an Accuracy of 84.49% on the Corpus.
